# Response from the Blumenstock article


### Joshua Blumenstock states that a humbler data science could transform international development while also limiting the number of alleged silver bullets that have missed their mark in recent years. Describe the promise, pitfalls and ways forward Blumenstock uses as the foundation for his thesis.
The promise is that big data analysis methods will improve humanitarian aid for those needed and global responses to crises.

However, Bluemenstock also indicates four problems with this tool: unanticipated effects, lack of validation, biased algorithms, and lack of regulation. Firstly, decisions made from big data analysis may not benefit vulnerable people as there are risks of misappropriation. Secondly, the risks and accuracy over time of some new algorithms have not been adequately tested before they are deployed. Thirdly, digital data and the algorithm derived from it are inherently biased, because most disadvantaged people who have no access to internet tend to be the least represented. Finally, because of the lack of regulation, companies who only want to maximize may abuse data collected from their users. 

For future, it is stated that new big data analysis methods should be accompanied by conventional data collection methods for validation,  customized by taking local context into account, designed by people who understand the actual problem instead of only the algorithm. 


### Additionally, consider the following statements from three of your classmates regarding this article. How do you response to these ideas regarding “good intent”, “transparency” and the difficult “balancing act” when consdiering the intersection of human development with data science?

### “Good intent is not enough in data science when dealing with the problems which determine people’s experiences” Anna Raymond

Only possessing a good intent is not enough for making appropriate decisions I believe, because sometimes good intent will also lead to unanticipated bad effect.  ‘Digital credit’ is an example: financial-service institutions provide countless loans to borrowers based on their digital credit, but they lead to issues like poverty cycles and debt traps. Moreover, since most disadvantaged people who have no access to internet tend to be the least represented, algorithm derived from digital data can be biased which makes the decisions hardly benefit the poor. 

### “Transparency is the underlying issue to many of these problems, so an increase in this on both ends (data based issues & human based issues) could lead to better results. Nira Nair

I agree with the statement. Unlike convention data collection process, private companies who only want to maximize their profit, generally own and control big data for their analysis, so they are likely to abuse their data for profit instead of pursuing the interests for most people.  Therefore, legislations and regulations to limit their abuse of power are so important, and algorithmic transparency will definitely assist such regulatory. 

## “In lieu of such drastic potential for promoting applications yet demoralizing hinderances, the balancing act can become difficult.” Kayla Seggelke

It can be really hard to prevent abusing the power of data in “data revolution” . The development of data science should be more “Humble” in which understanding the diversity of social and cultural environment and incorporating them into the model are as important as promoting applications.
