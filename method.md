### First method: Quantifying the Impact of Accessibility on Preventive Healthcare in Sub-Saharan Africa Using Mobile Phone Data 
Using anonymized mobile phone data from 2008 to 2009, the first geospatial model successfully analyzed travel patterns of 14,816,521 subscribers across Kenya and then quantified the relationship between physical accessibility to healthcare, actual travel behavior of a community, and the degree of preventive healthcare uptake. From 14,816,512 subscribers,  Mobile phone data including anonymized call detail records included the cell tower location (from one of 11,920 routing tower locations), sender, receiver, and timing of calls or SMS communications from June 2008 through June 2009 are collected. With these data, researchers first modeled the individual mobility of each subscriber using a measure called the radius of gyration, which encompasses both the range and frequency traveled by a person, with higher values indicating more mobile subscribers. The primary location (center of mass) for each subscriber is calculated based on the most common location over the course of the year using the tower location of each mobile phone communication. Based on the determined primary location, the radius of gyration for subscribers from each mobile phone tower is calculated using the following formula:
