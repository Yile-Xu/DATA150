# Methodological Investigation
### First method: Quantifying the Impact of Accessibility on Preventive Healthcare in Sub-Saharan Africa Using Mobile Phone Data 
Using anonymized mobile phone data from 2008 to 2009, the first geospatial model successfully analyzed travel patterns of 14,816,521 subscribers across Kenya and then quantified the relationship between physical accessibility to healthcare, actual travel behavior of a community, and the degree of preventive healthcare uptake. From 14,816,512 subscribers,  Mobile phone data including anonymized call detail records included the cell tower location (from one of 11,920 routing tower locations), sender, receiver, and timing of calls or SMS communications from June 2008 through June 2009 are collected. With these data, researchers first modeled the individual mobility of each subscriber using a measure called the radius of gyration, which encompasses both the range and frequency traveled by a person, with higher values indicating more mobile subscribers. The primary location (center of mass) for each subscriber is calculated based on the most common location over the course of the year using the tower location of each mobile phone communication. Based on the determined primary location, the radius of gyration for subscribers from each mobile phone tower is calculated using the following formula:

Then, the average radius-of-gyration values for subscribers were aggregated to obtain the distributions of mobility for populations on 2 spatial scales: the county level and the individual cell tower level (11,920 total towers). Population distribution was mapped using land cover and census data while the travel times between pairs of locations was calculated using a cost–distance algorithm which computes the “cost” of traveling on a regular raster grid based on information about the transportation network (obtained from the Kenyan national Bureau of Statistics). In addition, to map the distribution of preventive healthcare interventions uptake, they divided targeted region into 89 sublocation, and based on the geocoded survey data of basic health conditions for each households, calculated the percentage of households who were lacking either completed childhood immunizations and antenatal care (as two outcome variables). After obtaining all the measurement needed, the mobility data were modeled with the estimated travel times to nearest health facilities and geocoded data on the uptake of two preventive healthcare interventions. 

The resulting statistics shows that long travel times or poor physical access to healthcare is strongly correlated with increased mobility, which predicts the consequently more severe lack of preventive care of geographically isolated areas. This technique of using collected mobile phone data to map the uptake of preventive healthcare can be actively used as an important approach for quantifying the impact of poor physical access and long travel time on the amount of health care received and provide insights for alleviating health disparities and the unequal geographical accessibility in the development process of Kenya’s public health system.  It contributes to answering part of my research question of health inequality, by providing methods to assess the health outcome of unequal physical access to health facilities. 

### Second method: Access to emergency hospital care provided by the public sector in sub-Saharan Africa in 2015: a geocoded inventory and spatial analysis

The second geospatial model examined the variations of population’s geographical access to emergency hospital services within and between 48 sub-Saharan Africa countries, which essentially lead to heterogeneous mortality rated. Since a threshold of less than 2-h travel times are necessary for timely emergency hospital care like obstetrics and emergency surgical interventions, proportion of population located more than 2 hour travel time to the nearest hospital are considered as a major metric for geographical accessibility estimation. 

To determine the geographical access to hospital care, researchers first assembled a geocoded database of public hospitals with emergency services in sub-Saharan. For each country, data from national databases and International organizations like OCHA, WHO, and UNICEF were used to create the country-specific public hospital lists with their geographical coordinates indicated, and the missing coordinates of facilities were geocoded by Microsoft Encarta, Google Earth, and Geonames. Using a random forest technique, researchers disaggregated census data from WorldPop database for 2015 to land use and land cover grids, and created total population mappings at 1 km2 spatial resolution. Moreover, road network data which contains information about average motorised travel speeds are derived from Google Map Maker Project and OpenStreetMap using ArcMap, and major roads are classified as primary, secondary, and tertiary. In order to model time in hours needed to travel to the nearest public hospital based on all these data, researchers first generated a travel impedance surface by assigning different travel speeds to roads classified in different level, and varied the motorized speeds by roughly 20% to define an upper and lower bound of travel speeds for sensitivity analysis which wiped out any uncertainty. Non-road raster cells were assigned with a speeds of 5 km/h, assuming patients could walk or be carried. Then, based on both the impedance surface and location of public hospitals, travel time to the nearest facility was estimated using AccessMod(version 5), which aggregate both walking and motorized, and mapped geographically, while the proportion of population within 2 h-travel time to a hospital are calculated. 

The aggregated travel time mapping shows that 29% sub-Saharan Africa population are located more than 2 hour travel time from the nearest emergency hospital services, and significant variations in geographical accessibility exist between and within countries ranging from less than 25% of the population within 2-h travel time to more than 90%.  From this research, both the geospatial model for travel time mapping and the first geocoded database of public hospitals in sub-Saharan Africa assembled can further contribute to the between and within country assessment of varied geographical accessibility of all different kinds of health services extending beyond emergency hospital services, which is the key towards addressing limited health care received by geographically marginalized populations and alleviating public health disparities. It contributes to answering part of my research question regarding methods to mapping variations of geographical accessibility.
