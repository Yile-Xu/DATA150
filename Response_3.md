#### Question 1.  How does Owen Barder define development? How does he extend Amartya Sen's definition to include the idea of complexity?
Owen Barder defines development as a multi-dimensional property of the economic, social and political system itself. He extend Amartya Sen’s definition by claiming that development is not just the the sum of improvement in the well-being of individuals or output of firms in society.  Improving the overall economic, social, and political system is crucial for the individuals. 

#### Question 2.  Barder compared the economic growth of South Korea and Ghana between 1960 and 2010.  Why did he make this comparison?  What did this comparison demonstrate when used as the basis to validate economic models?
Barder compared the average income South Korea and Ghana and found out there are rapid growth of income for South Korea which exceeds Ghana. He made this comparison to introduce the following economic models he is going to describe. This comparison is also used as a basis for economic models validation by testing if the proposed economic model can explain the disparity from comparison. 

#### Question 3.  What was the toaster project? What did Thomas Thwaites attempt to do? Was he successful? What is the significance of this example in the context of complexity?
Thomas Thwaites attempts to make an electric toaster from scratch. He bought a cheap and simple toaster from the store. However, simple toaster is still complicated as it has 400 components made from different materials. It took Thomas 9 months and huge cost to make that toaster. Unfortunately, he was unable to get rubber to insulate copper wires, and when he turn on the toast, the toaster busted into flame. This example demonstrates that development is not marked by increasing in output of individual firms. A rich economical, social, and political system is necessary to provide individuals opportunity and improve their welfare. 

#### Question 4.  What was the Harrod Domar growth model? What are the two fundamental variables in this model? Who was Walter Rostow and what was the impact of his work on development?
Harrod Domar growth model claims that increase in output rely on both increase in amount of capital and increase in labor. Walter Rostow created the circle of economic growth, which claims that increase in investment will increase the amount of capital which will in turn promotes economic growth. This model rationales the foreign aid, and provides a way to calculate finance gap and the corresponding foreign aid or investment needed. 

#### Question 5.  What was the Robert Solow model?  How did it address the limitations of the Harrod-Domar model? Was this model successful at predicting economic growth?
Robert Solow construct a neoclassical growth model which adds a third variable called technical change to Harrod-Domar model. It addressed the limitations that Harrod-Domar model bears no resemblance to reality. Although Robert’s model fits actual data much better than Harrod Domar model, it still can not explain the low growth in poor country because knowledge can spread at cheap cost. 

#### Question 6. What was the Ajaokuta Steel works? How did it illustrate the transition from a focus on policies to institutions?  What is Acemoglu & Robsinson's book Why Nations Fail about?  How is their argument a response to the previously failed idea regarding engineering prosperity by providing the correct economic advice? 
Ajaokuta steel works in Nigeria is one of the largest investment of steel in the world. It illustrates that instead of policy, poor management and endemic corruption caused the low economic growth, which shift the focus from policies to institutions. Acemoglu & Robsinson's book Why Nations Fail claims that poor cultures are poor not because of their government’s mistaken policy.

#### Question 7.  According to Barder, how successful have economic models been at describing and predicting growth over the past 50 years?

According to Barder, the economic growth is rapid over the past 50 years. As the missing ingredient are, Economic models keep modifying the missing ingredients and turning their focus to endogenous, but they still fail to explain the economic growth difference between countries; 

#### Question 8.  What was the significance of Schumpeter's idea of creative destruction? How does it relate to firms and institutions? What is co-evolution and why is it significant?

Schumpeter’s idea of creative destruction explains the real situation in market place. Firm and industry adapt to its changing environment and evolve. Old outdated firms go bust and are replaced by new firms that are better adaptive to today’s environment.  Co-evolution is adapting together and it accelerate the development very effectively. 

#### Question 9. What is a complex adaptive system? What are some of its important features?
A complex adaptive system refers to a complex linear system. This system is difficult to predict in detail, and it keeps moving and becoming even more complex, which implies it does not have an equilibrium. 

#### Question 10.  Who was Haile Sellasie? What is the significance of Kapuscinski's book The Emperor? How did Ethiopia exemplify the suppression of emergent systemic change? Do you agree with this analysis?
Haile Sellasie was the Emperor of Ethiopia from 1930 to 1974.  Kapuscinski's book The Emperor analyzes the impact of suppression on institutions development on the society because of Haile Sellasie’s dictatorship. I agree that dictatorship leads to institution failure and also impact the whole society. 


#### Question 11.  Why does Barder recommend resisting engineering as a policy implication?  What did he mean by isomorphic mimicry?
Barder recommend resisting engineering as a policy implication because the changes happened in the evolutionary process is extremely hard to predict. Isomorphic mimicry is the tendency of governments to mimic other governments’ successes, replicating processes, systems, and even products of the “best practice” examples.


#### Question 12.  What did Barder mean by "resist fatalism"? Who was Norman Borlaug and what is the green revolution?
Resist fatalism means that people should not accept whatever outcome of evolution in terms of development. Norman Borlaug who increases crops' yield by crossbreeding is important in green revolution. Green revolution increased agricultural production worldwide through new technological means. 

#### Question 13.  Barder also recommended to promote innovation, embrace creative destruction and shape development.  What did he mean by these recommendations?
Barber believes that an social environment which encourages innovation should be promoted and people and more importantly to embrace creative destruction.  In addition, the goal of whole society should involve in shaping development. 

#### Question 14. Who was Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen and what was his insight about economic systems and evolution?
Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen is a mathematician, statistician and economist. He believes that humans should focus more on individuals’ social well beings like happiness instead of pursuing economic growth.
