## Title: Addressing health issues in Kenya through the improvement of its public health system 

### Introduction
The issue of health inequality and low coverage of public health services constantly torment people in developing countries including Kenya. Despite of considerable improvement on public health conditions over the last decades, geographical and socio-economic inequalities in health have persisted in almost all sub-Saharan African countries. People in poverty not have worse health but also suffer from lacking access to needed care services compared to wealthier population groups (Ilinca, et al). According to Amartya Sen’s definition of human development, having sufficient access to high quality public health facilities is an important aspect of social freedom for every human, which is part of overall freedom we are seeking to improve. Therefore, besides economic growth or increase in GDP, almost all the countries in the world have treated achieving health equality as one of their most important develop goals.  This literature review mainly focus on analyzing the main health disparities of Kenya with its causing factors Kenya and systematically study the different aspect of health inequality in context in order to provide insight for proposing solution. 

### The major health issues and its impact in Kenya
The uneven distribution of health services and especially the lack of services in rural areas causes significant public health issues in Kenya.  

Both under-5 mortality rate and maternal mortality rate remained high in Kenya with significant variations among different regions because of the unequal accessibility to health care. Although the under-5 mortality rate in Kenya decreased significantly for about a half, it failed to meet the Millennium Development Goal of a two-thirds reduction in under-5 mortality rate between 1990 and 2015. In 2019, Kenya’s Under-5 mortality rate reached 51.3 per 1000, but estimated by its current annual rate of reduction, it is unlikely for Kenya to reach the 2030 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target of 25 deaths/1000 live births. (Burke, Marshall, et al).  Maternal mortality fell from 315 deaths per 100000 in 1990 to 257 deaths per 100 000 in 2016, but the level of improvement is heterogeneous at subnational level (Tom, Achoki, et al). From the multivariable analysis on the determinants of under-five mortality rate conducted by Emily C Keats and her colleagues using data from nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys, variations in different region can be attributed to several main determinant factor of under-5 mortality including maternal literacy, household wealth, childhood immunization, maternity services, and maternal and infant nutrition. 

Communicable or infectious diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria caused the major burden on Kenya public health system. Moreover, urbanization and concentration of settlements in rural areas causes even higher burden of these communicable diseases although the mortality rate declines since 2000s (Iyer HS, et al). Kenya has among the highest rates of HIV/AIDS in the world, and the overall mortality trends increased between 1990 and 2006 and decreased between 2006 and 2016. However, HIV/AIDS-specific mortality rates in young men have continued to increase since 2006. Low levels of knowledge about sexual behaviors, disempowerment of young women to make decisions about sexual behavior, and use of alcohol and drugs contribute to higher rates of HIV/AIDS mortality in younger age groups (Tom, Achoki, et al). People in Kenya still stay vulnerable in disposition of malaria while malaria treatment and prevention interventions are distributed unevenly among different regions. The poorest population in Kenya still suffer from the least accessibility to malaria treatment. According to a study conducted in the poorest areas of four malaria endemic districts, about 40 percent of individuals self-treated using shop-bought drugs and 42 percent who visited a formal health facility reported not having enough money to pay for treatment, and having to adopt coping strategies including borrowing money and getting treatment on credit in order to access care. Drug and staff shortages are also commonly exist problem in local area. (Chuma et al.)

Although compared to communicable diseases, noncommunicable diseases or chronicle diseases such as cancers, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease takes up a relatively smaller proportion of burden on public health system, the burden from noncommunicable diseases in recent years increases because of urbanization and change in people’s lifestyle. Based on The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) conducted across the 47 counties of Kenya, population’s accessibility to health care stays limited. Take the preventive care like blood pressure checks and hypertensive diagnoses and treatment for example, more than half the population (56%) had never checked their blood pressure. In addition,  and within those who had been diagnosed previously as hypertensive, only 22% were on treatment (Tom, et al).

### Three aspect of health equality

Health equality is accompanied by increase in equitable access to health services and access can be defined in 3 perspective: availability, geographical accessibility, affordability (Iyer HS, et al.). There are three major types of health services including outpatient care, inpatient care, and preventive and promotive care. To get a systematic view of the unequal access of health care in Kenya, we should separately study and analyze the gap for Kenya fulfill each important perspective.  

From a geospatial study using mobile phone data to quantify the impact of geographical accessibility on uptake of preventive healthcare, it is concluded that long travel times to health facilities is strongly correlated with increased mobility in geographically isolated areas, and in areas with equal physical access to healthcare, high mobility predict which regions are lacking preventive care (Wesolowski, et al). This implies that the region of residence is a key driver for inequality in preventive care and improvement in geographical accessibility is essential for health equality. However, there is a tradeoff between health system’s efficiency and geographical equity. When making decisions on health facility distributions, policy-makers always need to balance the trade-offs between equity of geographical accessibility and health system efficiency. Allocating health facilities in urban areas with more concentrated population will improve the system’s efficiency because of the economies of scale. However, preferential deployment of services in urban area will exacerbate urban rural disparities and health inequality. In order to achieve more equitable geographical accessibility for the whole country, some efficiency has to be sacrificed.
Therefore, the development goal is improving the allocation of public facilities in order to increase the health equity in Kenya while also ensure the efficiency.
